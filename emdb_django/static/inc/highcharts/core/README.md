#This folder contains distributions of the Highcharts Javascript charting package


* Every distribution should be in a separate sub-folder, e.g. v4.0.1
* The "current" sub-folder is a copy of the most recent distribution, currently v4.0.1
* Programs should normally use the "current" sub-folder and not explicit versions!
* Third party modules should go into the extlib sub-folder

##Change log
* 24/7/2014; Ardan Patwardhan: Removed legacy directories

##TODO
----
* There are legacy directories here for an older version of Highcharts that needs to be cleaned up
